\# Global Air Quality \& Weather Data Unification



\## Domain

Environment / Smart Cities



\## Difficulty Level

High



\## Project Overview

This project focuses on unifying, cleaning, and analyzing multi-source air quality and weather data to support real-time analytics, forecasting, and decision-making for smart city applications.



The workflow covers the complete data lifecycle — from raw data ingestion and profiling to advanced predictive modeling and association rule mining.



\## Objective

To integrate heterogeneous environmental datasets (air quality sensors, weather data, and geolocation metadata) into a clean, analysis-ready dataset that enables:

\- Air Quality Index (AQI) analysis

\- Trend visualization and dashboards

\- PM2.5 forecasting

\- Pattern discovery using association rules



\## Data Sources

\- OpenAQ (air pollution data)

\- Historical air quality datasets

\- Weather station data

\- City-level geolocation metadata



\## Project Workflow

1\. Setup and Environment Configuration  

2\. Data Ingestion  

3\. Data Profiling and Exploratory Data Analysis  

4\. Schema Alignment and Standardization  

5\. Data Cleaning (Interpolation, IQR capping, validation)  

6\. Data Validation and Integration  

7\. Data Export and Documentation  

8\. Data Dictionary Creation  

9\. Export of Final Datasets  

10\. Visual Insights and Static Dashboards  

11\. Interactive Dashboard using Plotly  

12\. Predictive Modeling using Regression Techniques  

13\. Advanced Models: XGBoost and LightGBM  

14\. Model Performance Comparison (R² Score)  

15\. Time Series Forecasting for PM2.5  

16\. Association Rule Mining using Apriori Algorithm
