\# Global Air Quality \& Weather Analytics



\## Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end analysis of global air quality and weather data.

The objective is to clean, unify, analyze, and model pollution patterns, with a primary

focus on \*\*PM2.5 concentration prediction\*\*.



The project demonstrates a complete data analytics pipeline, including:

\- Data profiling and cleaning

\- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

\- Feature engineering

\- Regression and machine learning models

\- Time-series forecasting

\- Association rule mining (Apriori)

\## Dataset Description

The dataset contains air quality and weather measurements collected across multiple cities.



\*\*Key variables include:\*\*

\- Air pollutants: PM2.5, NO₂, O₃

\- Weather factors: temperature, humidity, wind speed

\- Temporal data: timestamp

\- Spatial data: latitude, longitude



All datasets are cleaned, validated, and standardized before analysis.
